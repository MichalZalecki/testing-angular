# Testing AngularJS with Jasmine and CoffeeScript

Hi, mate! This repo was created as a background for my presentation in Bydgoszcz, Poland about testing AngularJS apps. In this project you can find sample controller, directive, filter, service and factory which are tested and written in CoffeeScript. Also there are some E2E test.

## Instalation

To get this code up and running you have to clone this repo and install required dependencies such as [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) i [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/)

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/MichalZalecki/testing-angular
```

This project was build on top of [anguloffee](https://github.com/MichalZalecki/anguloffee). It's AngularJS with CoffeeScript starter which I recommend and use by myself.
